			<h1>Tabs Dustin, Tim, Ryan</h1>
			<p>This story began with four Dj's accross the States. First we have Mister JQuery(Ryan) from Miami who made a name for himself as the Bad Boy of South Beach. Next we have Bang! Bang!(Tim) straight outta D.C. the president of Dj's. Next we have JSon(Jason) outta San Deigo bringing that beach vibe everywhere he goes. Last but not least we got Sin City's own Dusty Ajax(Dustin). JQuery, Bang! Bang!, and Json all took their talents to Sin City they all would meet each other working gigs in Vegas and became good friends. One day Jquery now only known as Ryan decided to lay down his records and try his hand at cooking. Tim, Dustin and Jason would tell Ryan he should try out for a cooking show so he did. He made top 80 on MasterCook and six months later he was MasterCook Champion. Ryan then had an idea to start up a restaurant with his friends. We joined together and started working right away. It took awhile to come up with a theme for which we all agreed on but leave it to Tim to bring it and say why dont we "bring the beach to the valley". We loved that idea not long after Tim also came up with our restaurant name "Lagoon Valley, LV". That was it we never looked back been business partners since we open these doors on September 26th 2016. We have more ideas up our sleeve join our newsletter to see what project we have in store we could be coming to your city next. </p>
